# recommender

This is a recommend system based on Amazon review data about video games. You can download data from https://download.csdn.net/download/qq_41103204/19123554.


There are four parts in this project.

- **Eda and benckmark** In this part, I analyzed data to know the distribution of the data and different features. Besides, I did some basic and easy prediction as benchmark, which could be compared with advanced models.
- **Models** In this part, I build three models, including Baseline, SGD, KNN and tuned the parameters.
- **Emotion process** In this part, I add emotion of reviews in order to improve the performance of recommend system.
- **nn model** This is used to auto-label the rating for every review.
